# hello-world
This is a test repository following the Github Hello World Tutorial

This file, being a README file, doesn't actually do anything -- rather it just provides a description of the Repository or the Branch. 

In accordance with the instructions of the Hello World GitHub tutorial, I will write a bit about myself here. 
I am a 24 year old American with a bachelors degree working as a Transfer Pricing Consultant for PwC in Mexico City. 
I'm interested in learning more about Statistical Analysis and am interested in becoming a Data Scientist.

I'm creating a new branch to explain in my own words how branches work. 
When a branch is created, a copy of the master is created in which you can work on adding additional content, without risking messing up the master. Once a branch is completed, revised, and correct, then it can be merged into the master so that the master is updated with the changes. Changes are saved in the branch by selecting "Commit Changes".
The changes of the branch are then incorporated into the master by:
1. Opening a Pull request, and then
2. Merging the pull request

# hello-world
This is a test repository following the Github Hello World Tutorial

This file, being a README file, doesn't actually do anything -- rather it just provides a description of the Repository or the Branch. 

In accordance with the instructions of the Hello World GitHub tutorial, I will write a bit about myself here. 
I am a 24 year old American with a bachelors degree working as a Transfer Pricing Consultant for PwC in Mexico City. 
I'm interested in learning more about Statistical Analysis and am interested in becoming a Data Scientist.
